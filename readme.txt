This plugin for WPML enabled sites allows you to easily perform a language check (including language detection) on your translated content.

== Description ==

When surfing the Internet, how often have your come across an incorrectly translated webpage?

Having a website with a lot of elements (posts, pages, products or some other custom post) means it's difficult to know if ALL the content of all the elements is written in the correct language or simply the translator forgot to translate something.

This plugin helps us to carry out a language check of all our WordPress content, and to maintain language coherence throughout the website.

= How does it work? =

For example, take an e-commerce website in two languages: English and Spanish.

The plugin retrieves the product description from each language, and shows in a table what language the description should be written in and what language it's actually written in.

Thus, you can see visually which products in their Spanish version have an English description.

**Important: this plugin requires WPML installed.**
